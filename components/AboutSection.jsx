              almost on my profiles mean, then you just need to relax I&apos;ll
              explain it to you innabit.

              The truth is that there isn&apos;t anything special about the{" "}
              {'"gzk"'}, it is just a combination of the first consonants of my
              real names (Godswill eZihe oKechukwu). You get it now? if you

              My journey as a software engineer started in 2018 when a close
              friend first introduced me to computers. He used to code in Python
              (a programming Language) those days and I can&apos;t forget how

              someone in real life used the command line interface. At this
              point, I was seeing him as an Idol but he didn&apos;t know.
            </p>
            <p>
              I never was serious with learning how to code until 2020, it was
              largely because I wasn&apos;t computer literate as of then and I
              didn&apos;t have access to my own computer.
            </p>
            <p>
              The year was 2020, I just started my first semester at Nnamdi
              Azikiwe University where I was studying Pharmacy. Around February,
              the Academic Union of Nigerian Universities went on strike and the
              covid19 crisis followed suit which made students stay at home for
              almost a year.
            </p>
            <p>
              It was during the covid19 pandemic that I took coding seriously, I
              taught myself HTML and CSS thoroughly and started writing little
              JavaScript for my applications and websites. By October 2020, I
              got my first internship at Silicon Africa LLC (a digital agency)
              in South East. My experience at this Silicon Africa was a rich one
              I can&apos;t stop talking about.
            </p>
            <p>
              Fast forward to 2021, the long strike by the Academic Union was
              called off and I went back to school. Around February this period,
              I took a course on product design and interned at Utiva Inc as a
              product designer. This experience exposed me to solid UX design
              principles and helped me develop a better perspective towards
              building user-focused products as a frontend engineer
            </p>
            <p>
              We are now here in 2022, at this point I focus more of my time
              learning more of React, JavaScript, Math, Computer Science, Data
              Structures and Algorithms.
            </p>
            <p>
              Also, I practice whatever I learn by building simple to medium
              sized projects which are littered all over my Github account
